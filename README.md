# CSE 151 Project - Analyzing Movie Datasets

## Introduction

In this research project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of datasets pertaining to the film industry. Our investigation encompasses three primary datasets, each providing valuable insights into different aspects of the movie world:

1. **Kaggle Movies Dataset by Daniel Grijalvas**: This dataset contains extensive information about movies, including data on budget, revenue, and ratings.

2. **Movie Dataset by UCI Machine Learning Repository**: This dataset offers a deeper understanding of various movie attributes, including their types and ratings.

3. **Box Office Collections Dataset from Kaggle**: This dataset provides insights into the commercial performance of movies.

Our objective is to employ a rigorous analytical approach to uncover intricate relationships between various factors in the film industry. Specifically, we seek to:

- Examine the correlation between a movie's budget and its box office performance.
- Assess the influence of critical and commercial reception on financial outcomes.
- Identify patterns in audience preferences across different time periods.

## Research Goals

Through this multidimensional analysis, our research group endeavors to provide a holistic understanding of the factors contributing to a movie's success, encompassing both its commercial and critical acclaim. Our findings aim to offer valuable insights to stakeholders involved in the filmmaking process, marketing, and industry analysis.

## Machine Learning Model

For the purpose of this research, we have employed a robust machine learning model, the **Decision Tree Classifier**, to aid in our analysis and predictions. This model enables us to make data-driven decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from the complex datasets under scrutiny.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Details about how the datasets were obtained and prepared for analysis. In the preprocessing step, we clean the data by handling missing values, normalize numerical values to ensure uniform scales, and encode categorical variables as necessary. For the Kaggle Movies Dataset, we also adjust budget and revenue figures for inflation to enable accurate comparisons over time. Our Jupyter notebook, [Data Preprocessing and Exploration](https://github.com/arandersen/CSE_151_Project/blob/main/Project%20(2).ipynb), provides a detailed walkthrough of these steps.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Comprehensive exploration and visualization of the datasets to gain initial insights.

3. **Feature Engineering**: The process of selecting and transforming relevant features for our analysis.

4. **Machine Learning Model**: A detailed explanation of the Decision Tree Classifier and how it is utilized in our research.

5. **Results and Interpretation**: Presentation of our findings, analysis of results, and their implications.

6. **Conclusion**: A summary of the key takeaways from our research and their significance.

7. **Future Work**: Suggestions for further research or improvements to the analysis.
